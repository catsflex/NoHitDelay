This mod fixes an OLD, weird Minecraft behavior, where missing a hit (swinging at air) triggers a 10-tick timer (0.5s) during which your hits would stop registering. Turns out, this is STILL an issue in modern versions of Minecraft.

**Note:** Technically, this mod IS an unfair advantage. Use it at your own risk.
